// On-device multilingual emoji suggestion for JavaScript, server-side (Node).

// Node resolves this file, browsers resolve `browser.js`. No flags, no setup.
//
// The koffi harness (resolve native/<platform>-<arch>, load the LiteRT runtime
// first, bind the C ABI, run blocking calls off the event loop) and the FFI
// buffer decode live in @desert-ant-labs/core/node; this file supplies the C
// ABI, the model decode, and the public API.
